# Stairway to Heaven Senior Design team
Stairway to Heaven has been tasked by Dr. Christian Cousin to design a robot to assist the elderly in carrying objects up and down stairs to minimize fall risks. This robot climbs up and down stairs while safely carrying a load (i.e., a portable oxygen tank) and is portable, so that the robot is not confined to a singular environment. This GitHub contains all software for the project allowing for public viewing. Due to Arduino limitations, the main code is housed in the "Global" folder, containing multiple sketch files. A libraries folder is also included such that the entire directory can be cloned and ran on the robot.
